            In the world, about 4 million individuals suffer from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), with the incidence continuing to rise. This includes conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, which cause chronic intestinal inflammation and significant health issues.

            <div class="homepage-contents-style" style="width:460px;margin-top:50px;">
                Inflammatory bowel disease(IBD) is categorized into Crohn's disease(CD) and ulcerative colitis(UC), which are distinct chronic bowel-relapsing inflammatory disorders. Both conditions tend to have episodic flares of diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, and unintentional weight loss. Furthermore, the symptoms of IBD not only causes acute physical pain, but also makes it difficult for individuals to maintain their daily routines, work, or participate in social activities, which significantly increase the risk of depression, anxiety and feelings of isolation.

            <div class="homepage-contents-style" style="width:460px;margin-top:50px;">
                Beyond the individual level, IBD also has profound impacts on economy and society as a whole. The disease is associated with significant healthcare costs, lost productivity, and absenteeism, causing a economic burden on patients, families, and society. In the United States alone, the annual direct and indirect costs of IBD are estimated to be over $12 billion and the number is still rising.

            <div class="homepage-contents-style" style="width:800px;margin-top:50px;">
                The incidence of IBD rose steadily in the twentieth century in the Western world, which has affected approximately 2 Million people in North America and Europe, and over the past few decades, IBD in newly industrialized countries in Asia, South America and the Middle East, especially India and China where it used to be an unpopular disease, the incidence rate increased dramatically in recent decades.

                The cause of IBD is unknown, which makes it difficult to cure IBD with current medical treatments. Though current treatment options are complex, methods from symptom control to treat-to-target algorithms are all used in order to optimize treatment result, drug therapy and is still the most popular and effective treatments used for IBD. But there are problems such as high dosage requirements, long cycles and severe side effects.</div>

                Considering that levels of many disease-related biomarkers are dynamic and difficult to capture and monitor in native environments, we added a CRISPR-based genome editing system(CBE) to  amplify the inflammatory signal reaction. In this system, the translation of our drug protein, AvCystatin, was activated by CBE, which was expressed from PphsA to respond to thiosulfate levels in native environment, editing its promoter from ACG to ATG.  </div>

                AvCystatin was then exocrined and plays a crucial role in regulating macrophage immune responses, activating cellular MAP kinase and inducing the expression of IL-10 and IL-12/23, thereby effectively alleviating gut inflammation. </div>

                To control drug expression, we then added a ‘suicide switch’ into our system. As the patient's symptoms gradually improve, the level of nitric oxide in the gut decreases and the "suicide switch" within the probiotic is activated. 
                The PnorV promoter is inhibited, controlling the expression of CL protein, while the PL promoter is derepressed, inducing the expression of the MazF, a toxic protein which cleaves RNA to block protein synthesis, ultimately leading to cell apoptosis of our probiotic cells. </div>

                This probiotic system can diagnose and treat IBD in an effective, safe and relatively easy way. Though there are still a long way to go before it can be applied in clinical practice, we still wish our idea can bring new hope and possibility for IBD treatment and help IBD patients return to a normal life as soon as possible. </div>
