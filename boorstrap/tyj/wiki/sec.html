                <p>The ShanghaiTech University team has completed a 10-month journey, successfully closing the loop on our human practice endeavors. Right from the inception of our team, we have consistently prioritized the interests of stakeholders. Through a continuous process of interviews and extensive data research, we have seamlessly woven their ideas and interests into the fabric of our entire project. This has played a pivotal role in shaping our core values, solutions, and entrepreneurial strategies.</p>

                <div class="h2">The problem</div>
                <p>After four months of brainstorming, the ShanghaiTech University team has gained a profound understanding of the issues associated with <span style="color:#15EAEE;">lighting energy consumption</span>. In fact, fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, have been confirmed as the primary culprits behind global climate change. According to United Nations data, 80% of global primary energy demand comes from fossil fuels, and two-thirds of global carbon dioxide emissions originate from energy systems.</p>
                <p>What is concerning is that in China, in just the first half of 2021, coal consumption for electricity generation reached a staggering 1.57 billion tons, while gas consumption for power generation amounted to 182.7 billion cubic meters. Furthermore, according to statistics from the National Energy Administration, lighting electricity consumption in our country accounts for 10% to 12% of the total electricity generation. Through meticulous information research, we have clearly identified the environmental harm caused by lighting, as shown in the diagram below, and we are urgently seeking a cleaner solution to address this issue.</p>

                <p>So what is the solution?</p>
                <p><span style="color:#15EAEE;">LAMPS (Luminous Algae Material Presenting System)</span> has emerged as a green lighting solution in response to this challenge. It is based on biotechnology, relies primarily on solar energy, and integrates fusion proteins with Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) technology to <span style="color:#15EAEE;">enhance its illumination performance</span> within the visible spectrum. Moreover, LAMPS can automatically adjust its luminous intensity based on <span style="color:#15EAEE;">the day-night cycle</span>. Not only does LAMPS offer significant advantages in energy consumption, but it also places environmental sustainability at the core of its lifecycle, <span style="color:#15EAEE;">encompassing production, usage, and disposal stages</span>. The following is an introduction to the advantages of LAMPS:</p>

                </div>
                <p>The introduction of LAMPS technology has injected fresh vitality into traditional lighting methods, and in some application scenarios, it's even become the hot, go-to choice! The widespread adoption of this technology will not only better meet our energy needs but also alleviate environmental pressures, significantly propelling the sustainable development of the lighting industry!</p>
