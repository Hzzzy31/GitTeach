            We ingest up to 5 grams of microplastics every week<sup>1</sup>. A large part of the microplastics we consume
        comes from eating food contaminated by plastics used in agriculture<sup>2,3</sup>.Microplastics are small plastic particles derived from non-degradable plastics that mechanically break down into smaller parts, which
        causes microplastic pollution<sup>4</sup>.This breakdown into microplastics, as well as even smaller nanoplastics, allows for the uptake of these particles into cells<sup>5,6</sup>. In soil, microplastics also act
        as a vector for organic pollutants like pesticides and industrial chemicals, as well as for heavy metals such as
        cadmium, chromium, and copper. These compounds adsorb to the surface of the microplastics and in turn are taken
        up by plants (Figure 1). When these plants are eaten, this leads to the accumulation of microplastics, heavy
        metals, and toxic compounds in the human body. To date, microplastic accumulation has been found in essentially
        all human tissues, in the bloodstream, and in fetuses<sup>7</sup>. Recent studies have already found a range of
        adverse effects on the respiratory tract, cardiac health, neurological health, mitochondrial health, and on
        oxidative stress<sup>8,9</sup>.
