                The goals of the three groups of engineering modifications are:
                1. To increase the fluorescent substrate of the bacteria through metabolic adjustment;
                2. To enhance the luminous intensity and broaden the spectrum through protein engineering;
                3. To verify the relevant original components through the recombinant transformation of cyanobacteria.
                The entire engineering process is carried out logically under the principles of DBTL (Design, Build, Test, Learn) recommended by iGEM. We continue to carry out transformation and iteration to improve our projects. The following is the experimental content and logic network we have completed.
